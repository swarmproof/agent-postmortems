# Contributing to agent-postmortems

Thanks for helping build **agent-postmortems** — part of the [Swarm Proof toolkit](https://github.com/swarmproof).

## Ways to contribute
- **Good first issues** — look for the `good-first-issue` label. A few are seeded to get you started.
- **Bug reports** — open an issue with a minimal reproduction.
- **Features & discussion** — open an issue before a large PR so we can align on direction.

## Development
1. Fork and clone.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/<short-name>`.
3. Keep commits atomic and use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, ...).
4. Open a PR describing *what* changed and *why*.

## Contributing an incident

1. Copy [`incidents/_TEMPLATE.yaml`](./incidents/_TEMPLATE.yaml) to `incidents/<incident_id>.yaml` — the filename must equal `incident_id` (`YYYY-kebab-slug`).
2. Fill the required core; add as much of the optional body as the sources support. Classify with the taxonomy in [`TAXONOMY.md`](./TAXONOMY.md).
3. Validate locally: `uv run scripts/validate.py` and `uv run scripts/check_links.py`.
4. Open a PR — the PR template contains the checklist below, and CI enforces every gate.

### Sourcing rules (the one rule)

- Every incident needs **at least one public, linkable source**. No rumors, no anonymous accounts, no speculation about intent.
- Prefer the strongest source type available: primary research writeup, vendor disclosure, or court/regulatory record over news coverage.
- Set `confidence` honestly: `reported` (single source) · `corroborated` (multiple independent) · `confirmed` (first-party/vendor/court) · `disputed` (facts contested).
- Label researcher PoCs and near-misses `incident_type: hazard` — honesty over drama.

### Neutrality rules

- Report factually; name systems as data, never as targets. No blame adjectives (CI lints for these).
- Root causes are **systemic, not personal** (blameless post-mortem style).
- Never identify harmed individuals beyond what public sources already published.
- If a vendor disputes a record, we add their response as a `vendor-response` source and set `confidence: disputed` — sourced incidents are never deleted (ADR-0008).

## Principles (shared across the toolkit)
- **Provider-agnostic** — no hard dependency on a single model vendor.
- **Honest over impressive** — we don't overpromise guarantees; we document boundaries.
- **Watchable & reproducible** — outputs should be seedable and screenshot-worthy.
